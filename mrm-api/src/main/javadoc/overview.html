    <li>
        The base contract is provided by {@link org.codehaus.mojo.mrm.api.FileSystem}. This is a raw file system
        that is not aware of the Maven layout or metadata.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Maven aware {@link org.codehaus.mojo.mrm.api.maven.ArtifactStore} contract which can be converted into
        the base contract through {@link org.codehaus.mojo.mrm.api.maven.ArtifactStoreFileSystem}.
